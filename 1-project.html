<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Redsun2020: REVISE is an ambitious reimagining of the classic Redsun2020 mod for Deus Ex. Set in a near-future Tokyo, this storyline plunges players into a dark and gripping narrative of corporate power, underground resistance, and the struggle for survival. As J.C. Denton, you navigate through labyrinthine plots involving shadowy factions, powerful organizations, and a city on the brink of chaos. The adventure spans diverse locations, from the neon-lit streets of Shinjuku to the hidden depths of the Kurokuma hideouts, each with its own unique challenges and secrets.
</p>
<p>Players can expect a completely revamped experience with new dialogues, sidequests, enhanced textures, voice-acted characters, and a deeper gameplay experience that breathes new life into the Redsun2020 universe. This project builds upon the classic Deus Ex experience, combining new gameplay mechanics, enhanced AI, and detailed story progression to create a mod that is both nostalgic and refreshingly new.</p>

    <h3>Project Setup</h3>
    <p>This project began in early 2024. The initial goal was simply to add voices to existing NPCs without changing other elements. However, as my understanding grew and I was able to acquire all necessary assets, I started modifying other aspects of the game. By mid-2024, I realized I had developed the skills and gathered sufficient assets to undertake a complete revision of the mod.</p>
    <p>The project is divided into four main parts (milestones):</p>

    <h4>PART 1</h4>
    <p>Part 1 includes all levels from the "Escape from Otemachi Labs" sequence up to Hibiya Park Towers, concluding when Joseph rides the Aqua Bus to Shinjuku Station. The Alpha Gold release for Part 1 occurred in November 2024.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two Introduction cinematic levels</li>
        <li>Otemachi Labs 1</li>
        <li>Otemachi Labs 2</li>
        <li>TMG Complex</li>
        <li>Otemachi-ku</li>
        <li>Hibiya Plaza</li>
        <li>AquaBus Terminal</li>
        <li>Passageways</li>
        <li>Hibiya Park Towers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Total: 10 maps</strong></p>

    <h4>Part 2</h4>
    <p>Part 2 consists of 5 maps. Most of these levels will be significantly revised compared to the original mod. Notably, Kabuki-cho will be created entirely from scratch. As such, this part may require more development time. Concurrently, I will be updating Part 1 based on player feedback. Additional plans include adding new custom dynamic music tracks, new custom triggers, a new install script, new custom classes, and new custom 3D brushes. Furthermore, this development site is being created to better document and organize project assets. The target milestone date for completion is December 2025. <em></em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shinjuku Station</li>
        <li>West Shinjuku</li>
        <li>Kabuki-Cho</li>
        <li>East Shinjuku</li>
        <li>Yokotani Bank</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Total: 5 maps</strong></p>

    <h4>Part 3</h4>
    <p>Part 3 includes at least six levels, with plans to likely add one more. Many of these levels are set in underground locations and Yakuza hideouts. Lost City will likely be completely revised, potentially with an associated new level. The development plan is to begin in January 2026 and target completion by June 2026.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Galaxy Disco</li>
        <li>AquaGrill</li>
        <li>Kurokuma Base 1</li>
        <li>Kurokuma Base 2</li>
        <li>Kurokuma Hideouts</li>
        <li>Lost City</li>
        <li>&lt;New level: TBD&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Total: 7 Maps</strong> (estimated)</p>

    <h4>Part 4</h4>
    <p>Part 4 will feature 5 levels plus a new secret level, marking the game's conclusion. This includes the TMG Complex Military levels and the finale at Tokyo Station. Significant revisions are planned for the Tokyo Station level. I am also considering adding a secret level accessible by successfully completing specific quests. The schedule for Part 4 depends on the completion of earlier milestones, with a current target window of July 2026 – November 2026.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Return to Otemachi-Ku</li>
        <li>TMG Complex Military 1</li>
        <li>TMG Complex Military 2</li>
        <li>TMG Complex Military 3</li>
        <li>Tokyo Station</li>
        <li>&lt;New Level: Secret Level&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Total: 6 Maps</strong></p>

    <h4>Final Release Schedule</h4>
    <p>The target schedule for the final public release is <strong>December 2026</strong>. However, as is common in game development, unforeseen delays, personal events, etc., could potentially push the release into 2027.</p>
