<h2>Background Storyline</h2>
<hr>

<h3>History of Nano-Implementation</h3>
<p>From the late 20th century, mankind began developing machine aids. Hearing aids were among the first advances, which gradually led to artificial working organs, and by 2025, several cases of artificial hearts had been successfully demonstrated. The combination of nanotechnology and artificial implants progressed to the point where, by 2030, UNATCO started experimenting to develop a type of super anti-terrorist agent. However, UNATCO found that current human DNA in its purest form could not be stable with nano-implants, as the immune system would automatically attack nano-cells.</p>
<p>The big breakthrough came in 2055 when UNATCO researchers solved this issue by using EGAC (Extraterrestrial Genetic Alteration Chemistry) as an engineered DNA source. Water samples from Mars contained extraterrestrial DNA, which could be cloned and used to stabilize the immune system. UNATCO created an augmented-enabled template from EGAC DNA, allowing nano-implants to successfully coexist with the human body.</p>

<h3>The EGAC DNA Project</h3>
<p>Only four agents were developed from this project. The first from this template was called A.D.A.M.. The second and third were Paul and J.C., who were sent out on missions in later years. Joseph was the final one from the template, which UNATCO redesigned and specially programmed to be a faithful agent with strong moral principles. Although all four are technically brothers, only Paul and J.C. know of each other. UNATCO never told them about A.D.A.M. and Joseph. Additionally, they decided not to tell Joseph that he had any brothers at all.</p>

<h3>Kidnapped by the TMG</h3>
<p>The location is set in Tokyo, Japan during the dark ages where many Yakuza factions are fighting to gain power over an unstable government. The Japan Government is investing all their resources in new technologies and military to bring down the threatening Yakuzas. The TMG (Tokyo Metropolitan Government) is an extremist faction and has become quite corrupted within the government that goes as far as stealing other countries secrets and technologies. In 2061, the TMG managed to kidnap an UNATCO agent called Joseph and brought him to their labs to find the secrets of augmented technologies to enhance their own military power. </p>
<p>A mysterious transmission occurs that wakes up Joseph and helps him escape from TMG labs. The source of the transmission is from UNATCO but shows up as “Unknown” to the TMG.but uses augmented technologies to communicate to Joseph under a special code name *Redsun2020*. The great adventure begins when Joseph escapes from these labs and finds himself disorientated in the middle of Tokyo.</p>

<h3>Rolling Text (when launching the game)</h3>
<p>A dark chapter unfolded in Japan when the rise of the Kurokuma Gang posed a significant threat to the Tokyo Metropolitan group [TMG], responsible for ensuring the safety of its citizens. Upon learning about the Kurokuma’s ascendancy, UNATCO immediately recognized them as a severe threat to global peace. The situation escalated when it was discovered that the gang had acquired plutonium, positioning them as a global menace. To counter this threat, the deployment of Joseph, a highly skilled augmented operative from UNATCO, was seen as the sole solution. However, complications arose when the TMG intercepted the operative first.</p>

<h3>Redsun2020 Transmission</h3>
<p>Hello Joseph. This is your commander at UNATCO headquarters. You're currently in an enclosed tube in one of Otemachi Lab's test chambers. I know you are a bit disoriented so let me give you a quick update.The Japanese Tokyo Government, or simply TMG, kidnapped you while in training at our Southeast Asia camp.We're not sure how they located you but they were able sneak into our training area and knocked you out while your augs were disabled. You're now at their Otemachi Labs located in Tokyo, Japan. There has been a local power struggle in the area and the TMG have been trying to steal augmented technology from us for several years to help gain power advantages according to Intel. It looks like this time they were successful and plan to dissect you to obtain several augmented technologies. You don't have much time so you need to escape from their labs. I contacted one of our undercover spies within the compound to secretly open the tube door but he cannot help you. Once the tube opens, you're on your own and must escape by all means possible. I can only provide you with the floor plans for the 2 levels above your immediate position but it should help. When you get to the next floor up, look for  Dr. Miyazaki..our spy, he should be in the south lab. He should help you get out of Otemachi labs. This is a one way encrypted transmission, I will be going under the alias of REDSUN2020. I will not be able to transmit again until you reach the front entrance of the Otemachi Labs. You'll notice the TMG has stripped you of most of your augmentation and you have no weapons. Once you get out to Otemachi district in Tokyo, our UNATCO guys will be able to pick you up and bring you home. Good luck!</p>
